I have also provided the notebook that I used to clean up the dataset (Clean_Flights_Data). For those of you who wish to try your hand at data cleaning, I have provided a notebook demonstrating data imputation data (Demo_Imputing_Data). You get to decide which version of the dataset you wish to use."

    "# Assignment Requirements\n",

    "* Load flights.csv into a dataframe and handle the missing values. Justify your approach!\n",
    "   - Warning!! You are going to need some of the rows/columns with missing values, so don't just throw them away while creating your dataframe\n",
    "* The column 'ARRIVAL_DELAY' tells you the number of minutes the flight actually arrived verses the scheduled arrival. There are a fair number of missing values for this column, impute (see demo below) this column. Document your approach!\n",
    "    - Hint: A negative number means the flight arrived early.\n",
    "    - Hint: What other columns might you use to fill in this missing data.\n",
    "* Provide an analysis of delayed flights based on the airport the flight originated from. your analysis should answer the following questions.\n",
    "    - Is the distribution of delayed flights normally distributed?\n",
    "        * Describe the shape of the distribution based on the QQ-plot.\n",
    "    - What is the probablity a flight leaving from a given airport will arrive at its destination late?  \n",
    "        * Hint: Calculate the probablity of late arrival at destination for each originating airport.\n",
    "    - Determine the originaing airport with the largest proportion of flights arriving late to their destination. Do the same for the airport with the smallest proportion. \n",
    "        * What is the difference between probablility and proportion? (see note below)\n",
    "    - What is the mean and std of late arrival times for both of these airports.\n",
    "        * Based on the mean and std information ONLY, which airport seems like a better choice?\n",
    "    - Use these two airports and compare their histograms of arrival delays with each other. \n",
    "        * Which airport seems like you would have a better chance at arriving at your destination on time? Use the histograms to backup your conclusion!\n",
